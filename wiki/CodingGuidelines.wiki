#summary Coding guidelines for musikCube

= General =
 * Use const variables or enums instead of macros
 * Use CamelCase for types and function names
 * Use pascalCase for variable names
 * One level of indentation is 4 spaces (no tabs)

= Classes =
 * Names of interfaces are prefixed with I.  Class names get no prefix
 * Refer to member variables and functions with the this pointer
 * Data member names don't contain a prefix
 * Use an access modifier for each declaration in a class

= Accessors =
 * Use Property(), SetProperty(..) instead of GetProperty(), SetProprety(...), e.g:
 
 {{{
   class Font
   {
   ...
   public:    int Size();
   public:    void SetSize(int newSize);
   ...
   };
 }}}
