== Overview ==

win32cpp is a lightweight C++ abstraction of the Win32 API. It
 * is small and easy to use
 * is event driven
 * is designed for use with the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_view_controller model-view-controller] design pattern
 * automatically double buffers all drawing (flicker free)
 * compiles cleanly
 * open source under the new bsd license
 * uses exception handling, and is exception safe

win32cpp depends on:
 * [http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/stl/ the standard template library]
 * [http://www.boost.org/ boost]
 * [http://sigslot.sourceforge.net/ sigslot]
 * [http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=484269E2-3B89-47E3-8EB7-1F2BE6D7123A&displaylang=en the platform sdk]

We are in process of documenting the public API. [http://clangen.org/projects/win32cpp/api/ You can view the progress here].
