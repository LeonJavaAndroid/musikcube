If you're going to test current trunk of mC2 you currently need to manually add the synchronize path.
 * Build mC2 and the plugins.
 * Start mC2.exe and then close it again so that the database is created.
 * Locate the database in C:\Documents and Settings\%username%\Application Data\mC2\local
 * Open the local_musik.db using sqlite.exe (download from http://www.sqlite.org)
 * In the sqlite prompt write  {{{INSERT INTO paths (path) VALUES ('C:/MyMusikPath/');}}} and press enter.
 * Close sqlite.exe and restart mC2.exe
 * mC2 will now start indexing the files in the added path. You can click on the genre/artist/album views "All" to refresh.
